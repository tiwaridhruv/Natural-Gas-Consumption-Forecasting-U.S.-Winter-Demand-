# ** Natural Gas Consumption Forecasting – U.S. Winter Demand**

This project explores and forecasts monthly U.S. natural gas consumption during winter months (November–March) using a combination of regression analysis and time series forecasting. The analysis integrates key demand drivers such as Heating Degree Days (HDD), Henry Hub gas prices, and storage levels to build predictive models and visualize consumption trends.

## 📈 Key Highlights

Applied multiple linear regression with interaction and lag variables to identify core demand drivers (R² = 57%)

Built a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model for improved forecast accuracy (lower MAPE)

Designed a Power BI dashboard to present forecasts, driver relationships, and What-If analysis scenarios

Forecasted natural gas demand for 2025 using model outputs and visual storytelling

## 📊 Tools & Techniques

Excel for data preprocessing and regression modeling

Power BI & DAX for interactive dashboarding and visualization

Statistical Methods: Regression with lag terms, Holt-Winters exponential smoothing

Evaluation Metrics: R², MAPE, Visual Forecast Comparison
